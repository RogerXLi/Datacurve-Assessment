# Datacurve-Assessment

This is my code for the assessment. In order to run this (in developer view), you can use `fastapi dev server.py` and `npm run dev` on the backend and frontend respectively.

The program uses Vite setup the react project, Tailwind CSS for styling, @monaco-editor/react for the code editor. The backend uses FastAPI and runs user-submitted code in a Docker container.
